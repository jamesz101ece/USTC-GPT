**Docker** should be turned on before enabling the service

The first time you use it, you should download docker-compose first
and run **docker-compose up -d** in the same directory
After that, the database is created: the corresponding code is **create_milvus.py**

Run **create_milvusDB.py, insert_db.py**, and enter **streamlit run app.py** in cmd to enter the USTCgpt interfaceã€‚

*insert_db.py* correspondingly inserted into the database

*search_db.py* corresponds to a search in the database

*create_milvusDB.py* generates a vector database in milvus, which is stored in the format of id, embedding, and text

*extract_embedding* the embedding vector generated by the corresponding extraction (the embedding model uses bge-large-zh, and the download address is https://huggingface.co/BAAI)

*judgement.py* corresponds to the search in the vector database, and the content/abstract of the data is retrieved with the questions in the QA data, and the rank of the correct answer is output to judge the search effect

*app.py* can generate a smart campus project interface
